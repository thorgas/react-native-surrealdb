# react-native-surrealdb

Native SurrealDB for React Native, backed by the official Rust SDK and exposed
through generated UniFFI/Hermes JSI bindings.

> This package is an early alpha. Pin the exact version and read the limitations
> before using it in an application.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add react-native-surrealdb
cd ios && pod install
```

Requirements:

- React Native 0.82 or newer with the New Architecture and Hermes enabled;
- iOS 15.1 or newer (arm64 devices and arm64/x86_64 simulators);
- Android API 24 or newer (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64, and x86).

## Connect and query

```ts
import { SurrealRecordId, connect } from "react-native-surrealdb";

const db = await connect({
  endpoint: "memory",
  namespace: "app",
  database: "app",
});

const [result] = await db.query("RETURN $person", {
  person: new SurrealRecordId("person:ada"),
});

await db.transaction(async (transaction) => {
  await transaction.query("CREATE person:ada SET name = $name", {
    name: "Ada",
  });
  await transaction.query("CREATE person:lin SET name = $name", {
    name: "Lin",
  });
});

await db.close();
```

`transaction()` begins one native SurrealDB transaction, passes a JavaScript
handle to the callback, and commits once the callback resolves. Each
`transaction.query()` is executed immediately inside that transaction. If the
callback throws, the transaction is cancelled and the original error is
re-thrown. For manual lifecycle control, use `beginTransaction()`, then call
`commit()` or `cancel()` on the returned handle.

```ts
const transaction = await db.beginTransaction();
try {
  await transaction.query("UPDATE account:one SET balance -= $amount", {
    amount: 10,
  });
  await transaction.query("UPDATE account:two SET balance += $amount", {
    amount: 10,
  });
  await transaction.commit();
} catch (error) {
  await transaction.cancel();
  throw error;
}
```

Transaction queries are sent individually and share the native transaction ID;
they are not buffered into one concatenated SurrealQL request. Await operations
in sequence, and do not reuse a handle after `commit()` or `cancel()`.

The alpha supports embedded `memory` and experimental `surrealkv://...`
endpoints, plus remote `ws://` and `wss://` endpoints. Remote connections can
select a namespace/database and authenticate with root or database credentials.

## Live queries

```ts
const subscription = await db.live<{ text: string }>(
  "LIVE SELECT * FROM message",
);

const notification = await subscription.next();
if (notification) {
  console.log(notification.action, notification.value);
}

await subscription.close();
```

`LiveQuery` is also an `AsyncIterable`, so it can be consumed with `for await`.
Closing is idempotent and cancels the server-side live query. Closing the
database closes its live queries and cancels its open transactions. Automatic
reconnection, re-subscription, and duplicate-event suppression are not yet
implemented; applications using remote live queries must currently handle a
dropped connection.

## Cancellation and limitations

Async operations accept `{ signal }` as their final options argument. The
package requires Hermes and React Native's New Architecture and cannot run in
Expo Go. Persistent SurrealKV support is experimental. Transaction callbacks
must finish before the database is closed, and remote connection recovery is
currently application-managed.

## Value transport

The JavaScript/Rust boundary preserves 64-bit integers, decimals, record IDs,
UUIDs, bytes, sets, `NONE`, and other SurrealQL-only values rather than losing
them through ordinary JSON conversion.

## Native development

The generated TypeScript/C++/platform glue is checked in. Release archives are
generated locally and ignored by Git because they are large.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter react-native-surrealdb run release:artifacts
pnpm --filter react-native-surrealdb run release:check
pnpm --filter react-native-surrealdb pack
```

Android generation requires Android NDK `27.1.12297006`, API level 24, and
`cargo-ndk 4.1.2`. See [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) for the complete release
procedure.
